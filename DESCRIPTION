Description: Handle data from evolve and resequence experiments. 
    Measured allele frequencies (e.g., from variants called from high-throughput 
    sequencing data) are compared using an update of the PsiSeq algorithm. 
    Functions for saving and loading important files are also included, as well 
    as functions for basic data visualization.
