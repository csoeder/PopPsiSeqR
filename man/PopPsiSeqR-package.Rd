\title{PopPsiSeqR: Process and Visualize Evolve & Resequence Experiments}
\description{
Handle data from evolve and resequence experiments. Measured allele frequencies (e.g., from variants called from high-throughput sequencing data) are compared using an update of the PsiSeq algorithm. Functions for saving and loading important files are also included, as well as functions for basic data visualization.
